Title: Key Functions I Use Often
Version: 0.1.1
Authors@R: person("Dan", "Garmat", email = "dgarmat@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This package stores various functions from workflows I reuse.
    These functions should eventually go into separate packages, but I want
    to have them in one place for now. Currently there are data assumption
    checking functions for pipelines, modelling functions for common tasks
    when modelling, and a handy clustering function.
